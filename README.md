Good Day.

I’m Kinsalvan

I’m interested in coding and developement in the fields of:

webdev
game mechanics
engineering robotics/machinery

iv'e so far started coding full time since December 2023. 
prior to this i was a chemical engineer in the field of organics, mining, agricultural and machine/pilot-plant manufacturing.
my coding knowledge in machines is within arduino/pi , Siemens Plcs.

I’m currently learning to improve webdevelopment skills within my current company. 
in free time if i am not focused on a specific task within the company, 
i am looking at different game engines and platforms and how to make use of them to do as a hobby.

Fun fact: you just lost the game :)
